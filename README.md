# Time Series Forecasting

This repository is a personal project for a centralized documentation about
the concepts and implementation examples 
of some of the most relevant methods and tools currently used for time series forecasting.  

###Topics:

- Introduction to time series (TS)
    - Description of data structure, AC Plots
    - Component decomposition
    - Stationary propoerties, Dickey-Fuller test 
    - Target transformations (Log, Cox-box)
    - Residuals 
    - Metrics to measure forecasting performance
- Statistical Models
    - Univariate TS modelling: Average, Exponential smoothing, ARIMA models
    - Multivariate TS & External-regressors
    - Component-based TS modelling(tools): Facebook's Prophet, RSTL
    - Structural TS modelling: Hierarchical time series, Bayesian structural TS
- Machine Learning Models
    - (Linear) Regression models & standard toolbox (SVM, GBDT)
    - Hidden Markov Models
    - Seq2seq models
    - Recurrent NN (RNN,LSTM)
    
- Use Bayesian forecasting
